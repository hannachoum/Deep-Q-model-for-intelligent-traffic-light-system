# Intelligent Traffic Light System (RL_Project)

## Overview
The "Intelligent Traffic Light System" applies reinforcement learning techniques ( Deep Q model) to optimize traffic light control, aiming to reduce traffic congestion and improve flow efficiency. This project is an innovative approach to address the challenges of urban traffic management.

## Features
- Application of reinforcement learning algorithms for traffic light control.
- Simulation environment for testing and evaluation.
- Analysis tools for performance metrics like traffic flow, waiting times, and congestion levels.

## Installation
To set up this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
